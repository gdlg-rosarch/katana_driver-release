ros-hydro-katana-arm-gazebo (1.0.2-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * gazebo urdfs: remove self_collide tags
    Due to fixed joint reduction, there is only one link in the resulting
    SDF anyway, so there is nothing to collide with. Apart from that, this
    never made any sense for static models anyway.
  * self_collide false for tall table
    The links of the table are statically connected.
    There's no need for collision checking here.
    gazebo5 raises a warning because the self_collide statements
    were inconsistent (not all specified) before.
